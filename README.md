# Hello, ElastiCache!

This is the code project for the [Hello, ElastiCache!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-elasticache) blog post. 

This episode: Amazon ElastiCache and distributed caching. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce Amazon ElastiCache and use it in a "Hello, Cloud" .NET website. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

# Our Hello, ElastiCache Project

Our project will create a handful of simple Razor pages for voting on a cuisine for a team dinner. Vote results will be captured in an ElastiCache Redis cluster.

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
